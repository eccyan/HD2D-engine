# Seurat — Sprite Art Pipeline

Seurat is a browser-based tool for generating, reviewing, and assembling pixel-art sprite sheets for the Vulkan game engine. It connects to a local [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) server for AI image generation and the bridge server for asset management.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start ComfyUI (must be running for generation)
cd tools/ComfyUI
./venv/bin/python main.py --listen localhost --port 8188 --force-fp32 --enable-cors-header "*"

# 2. Start the bridge server
cd tools/apps/bridge
pnpm dev

# 3. Start Seurat
cd tools/apps/seurat
pnpm dev
# Open http://localhost:5179
```

## UI Layout

Seurat uses a 3-pane layout:

| Pane | Width | Content |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Tree** (left) | 220px | Character & animation tree explorer |
| **Main** (center) | flex | Content viewer — concept art, animation preview, frame grid |
| **Right** (right) | 300px | Action panels — generation settings, review, atlas assembly |

### Tree Navigation

- Click **Manifest** to view stats and edit raw JSON
- Click a **character** to view/edit concept art and assemble atlas
- Click an **animation** to review frames, generate sprites, and preview playback

## ComfyUI Setup

Seurat requires a running ComfyUI instance with Stable Diffusion 1.5. ComfyUI **must** be started with `--force-fp32 --enable-cors-header "*"`. The `--force-fp32` flag is required on Apple Silicon (MPS) to prevent ControlNet precision issues that cause OpenPose pose guidance to fail. The `--enable-cors-header` flag is needed since Seurat makes cross-origin requests directly from the browser to the ComfyUI API.

### Required Models

Place these in your ComfyUI `models/` directories:

| Type | File | Directory |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Checkpoint** | `v1-5-pruned-emaonly.safetensors` | `models/checkpoints/` |
| **LoRA** | `PixelArtRedmond15V-PixelArt-PIXARFK.safetensors` | `models/loras/` |
| **ControlNet (Tile)** | `control_v11f1e_sd15_tile.pth` | `models/controlnet/` |

### Optional Custom Nodes

| Node | Purpose | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| [ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus) | IP-Adapter support | `git clone` into `custom_nodes/` |
| [ComfyUI-BRIA_AI-RMBG](https://github.com/ZHO-ZHO-ZHO/ComfyUI-BRIA_AI-RMBG) | Background removal | `git clone` into `custom_nodes/`, download `model.pth` into `RMBG-1.4/` |
| [ComfyUI-Frame-Interpolation](https://github.com/Fannovel16/ComfyUI-Frame-Interpolation) | RIFE frame interpolation | `git clone` into `custom_nodes/`, `pip install -r requirements-no-cupy.txt` (or `requirements-with-cupy.txt` for CUDA), restart ComfyUI |

#### RIFE Frame Interpolation Models

ComfyUI-Frame-Interpolation downloads RIFE models on first use. Available checkpoints:

| Model | Architecture | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `rife47.pth` | RIFE v4.7 | Recommended — reliable downloads |
| `rife49.pth` | RIFE v4.7 | May fail to download from mirrors |
| `sudo_rife4_269.662_testV1_scale1.pth` | RIFE v4.0 | Alternative |

Models are stored in `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Frame-Interpolation/ckpts/rife/`. If auto-download fails, manually place the `.pth` file there.

### ComfyUI Settings (in Seurat UI)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| URL | `http://127.0.0.1:8188` | ComfyUI server address |
| Steps | 30 | Diffusion sampling steps (IP-Adapter needs 30+ for convergence) |
| CFG | 7 | Classifier-free guidance scale |
| Seed | -1 | Random seed (-1 = random each time) |
| Sampler | `euler` | Sampling algorithm (recommended for Apple Silicon MPS) |
| Denoise | 0.55 | How much to change from the reference image (0 = no change, 1 = full regeneration) |

### LoRA Configuration

Add/remove LoRA models in the **LoRA** section. Each entry has:
- **Name**: filename without `.safetensors` extension
- **Weight**: strength of the LoRA effect (0.0–2.0, default 0.8)

### ControlNet Configuration

ControlNet tiles the concept art horizontally and uses it as conditioning to maintain character consistency across animation frames.

- **Model**: ControlNet model filename (without `.pth`). Clear to disable.
- **Strength**: conditioning strength (0.0–1.5, default 0.70)

### IP-Adapter + OpenPose Configuration

Uses IP-Adapter for character appearance consistency from concept art, combined with OpenPose ControlNet for per-frame pose control. Requires the optional models and `ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus` custom node.

- **IP Weight**: IP-Adapter influence strength (0.1–1.0, default 0.70)
- **Preset**: IP-Adapter model variant (default "PLUS (high strength)")
- **End At**: When IP-Adapter stops influencing generation (0.0–1.0, default 1.0). Lower values give the text prompt more control in later denoising steps.
- **Pose Model**: OpenPose ControlNet model filename (default `control_v11p_sd15_openpose`)
- **Pose Strength**: OpenPose conditioning strength (0.1–1.5, default 0.80)

When enabled, Seurat generates each frame individually with a programmatically rendered OpenPose skeleton matching the expected pose (idle breathing, walk cycle, run cycle) for each direction and frame index. Pose skeletons use a **14-keypoint format** (no mid_hip) where neck connects directly to r_hip and l_hip — this is the format OpenPose ControlNet v1.1 expects. Skeleton proportions must follow the standard OpenPose layout: **shoulders at the same Y as neck** (horizontal T-bar), head at ~12% from top, neck at ~22%, hips at ~45%. If shoulders are placed below the neck (Y-shape), the ControlNet fails to recognize the body.

**IP-Adapter embeds_scaling**: Pass-1 identity nodes use `"V only"` — this provides the best character consistency while letting the text prompt control composition, direction, and pose. Pass-2 chibi nodes use `"K+mean(V) w/ C penalty"` to reduce background leakage during style transfer. The `weight_type` is `"linear"` for all passes.

**Prompt override**: The Pipeline panel includes an editable **Prompt** textarea above Pass 1. When empty, auto-generated per-frame prompts are used. When filled, the custom prompt replaces the auto prompt for all frames, allowing quick iteration on prompt wording.

> **Note on frame prompts**: Frame prompts intentionally exclude the concept's `style_prompt` (e.g. "pen drawing, detailed linework") because IP-Adapter already transfers style from the reference image. Including style terms in the text prompt would double down on a specific style and fight against IP-Adapter. Direction terms (e.g. "facing right, right side profile, looking right") are placed first in the prompt for strongest orientation influence.

### Background Removal

Removes opaque backgrounds from generated sprites (SD 1.5 does not natively support alpha output). Requires the `ComfyUI-BRIA_AI-RMBG` custom node with its `RMBG-1.4/model.pth` weights.

- **Node**: ComfyUI class_type for the RemBG node (default `BRIA_RMBG_Zho`)

Background removal operates at multiple stages:

1. **Reference pre-processing**: When IP-Adapter + RemBG are both enabled, concept art and chibi reference images are run through RemBG *before* being fed to IP-Adapter. The cleaned images are then **composited onto a solid white background** (via `compositeOnWhite()`) to prevent black/transparent regions from muddying the IP-Adapter character identity embedding. Results are cached per-view direction.
2. **Inter-pass cleanup** (two-pass mode): RemBG runs between Pass 1 (concept+pose) and Pass 2 (chibi-fy). The extracted character is composited onto a **solid white background** before VAEEncode — this prevents black/transparent regions from becoming latent noise artifacts in Pass 2.
3. **Final output**: Standard RemBG on the final generated image.

Frame prompts use `plain white background, solid color background` (SD 1.5 handles solid white reliably) and negative prompts include environment-related terms (`detailed background, room, interior, exterior, furniture, floor, wall, ceiling, sky, ground, environment`).

### Skeleton Derivation from Anchor

Seurat can derive per-frame pose skeletons for all animations from the detected concept skeleton (the "anchor"). This replaces generic template poses with character-proportioned skeletons, improving pose accuracy during generation.

**How it works**: `deriveAllAnimationPoses()` takes the 14-keypoint skeleton extracted from the concept image and combines the character's actual Y-proportions (body shape) with template X-positions (directional poses) for each animation state (idle, walk, run) and direction (down, up, right, left). For animations with stride > 1 (e.g., run with stride=4), `interpolateTemplatePoses()` linearly interpolates between keyframes to produce skeletons for every frame.

**3-level pose fallback**: All pose lookups (PoseCell, SinglePoseEditor, PosePreview, generatePass, generateFrames) use this priority:
1. **Pose overrides** — manually edited keypoints via the pose editor
2. **Derived poses** — character-proportioned skeletons from the anchor
3. **Template poses** — generic hardcoded skeleton templates

When the derived pose array is shorter than the manifest frame count (e.g., 4 derived poses for 16 frames due to interpolation multiplier), lookups use modulo cycling: `derivedPoses[frameIndex % derivedPoses.length]`.

**Persistence**: Derived poses are stored in `manifest.derived_poses` (a `DerivedPoseMap` keyed by animation name) and restored on character select.

**Pipeline integration**:
- Click **"Derive Poses from Anchor"** in the Pipeline Controls panel (requires detected skeleton from Concept tab)
- The button shows status: "16/16 poses derived" or "Anchor skeleton required"
- Derived pose cells show a **green border**, overridden poses show **orange**
- Click any pose cell in the pipeline grid to open the SinglePoseEditor

### Frame Interpolation

Generates in-between frames from existing pass 2 (chibi) outputs to create smoother animations. Interpolation sits between Pass 2 and Pass 3 in the pipeline, operating on 512x512 frames before pixelization.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Method** | Canvas Blend | `Canvas Blend` — instant client-side alpha crossfade. `RIFE (ComfyUI)` — AI-powered optical flow interpolation via RIFE VFI node (requires ComfyUI-Frame-Interpolation). |
| **Multiplier** | 2x | Number of output frames per original pair: 2x doubles frame count, 3x triples, 4x quadruples. |
| **RIFE Model** | `rife47` | RIFE checkpoint to use (only relevant when method is RIFE). |

**Manifest integration**: The interpolation multiplier is stored in `spritesheet.interp_multiplier`. When creating a new character, placeholder frames (`keyframe: false`, `status: "pending"`) are pre-populated between keyframes based on the current multiplier setting. This means the manifest always reflects the intended frame count from the start.

**Keyframe tracking**: Original frames are marked `keyframe: true`, interpolated frames `keyframe: false`. The grid shows interpolated frames with an "interp" badge. All frames are first-class — Pass 1 and Pass 2 generate for every selected frame (no automatic keyframe-only filtering). Use **Revert to Keyframes** to discard interpolated frames and restore originals.

**Workflow**:
1. Set the interpolation multiplier before creating a character (placeholders are pre-populated)
2. Generate Pass 1 + Pass 2 frames — only keyframes are generated
3. Click **Interpolate** — in-between frames fill the existing placeholder slots
4. Run Pass 3 (pixelization) on all frames including interpolated ones
5. Assemble atlas — spritesheet columns already account for the full frame count

**Canvas Blend** is fast and requires no external dependencies — use it for quick previews. **RIFE** produces higher quality motion-aware interpolation but requires ComfyUI with the Frame-Interpolation custom node. Seurat auto-detects the available RIFE node variant (`RIFE VFI`, `VFI_RIFE`, or `RIFEInterpolation`) and queries its schema for required inputs.

## Generation Modes

Seurat automatically selects the generation mode based on available assets and settings:

| Mode | When | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **txt2img** | No concept art uploaded | Generates from text prompt only |
| **img2img** | Concept art exists, ControlNet model cleared | Uses concept art as starting image |
| **ControlNet + img2img** | Concept art exists + ControlNet model set | Tiles concept art for ControlNet conditioning + img2img |
| **IP-Adapter + OpenPose** | IP-Adapter enabled + concept art exists | Per-frame generation with character consistency + pose control |
| **IP-Adapter (chibi)** | Chibi generation from Concept Art view | txt2img + IP-Adapter for chibi proportions with character identity |

### Generation Scope

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Single** | Generate one frame at a time |
| **Row** | Generate all frames of an animation as one wide image, then auto-slice into individual frames |
| **All** | Generate all pending frames across all animations (row mode per animation) |

Row mode generates a horizontal sprite strip (e.g., 512x128 for 4 frames of 128x128) and slices it into individual frame PNGs. This produces more consistent animations than single-frame generation.

When IP-Adapter + OpenPose is enabled, row mode generates each frame individually (per-frame pose skeletons) rather than as a single strip.

### Chibi Generation (IP-Adapter Only)

Chibi generation uses **txt2img + IP-Adapter** (no ControlNet or img2img). This approach generates chibi versions from scratch using the prompt to control proportions (2-head body ratio, big head, small body), while IP-Adapter preserves the character's identity from the concept art reference image.

This is better than the previous img2img approach, which forced a tradeoff: low denoise preserved the concept but couldn't change body proportions, while high denoise changed proportions but lost character identity.

**IP-Adapter settings** (adjustable in the Chibi UI):

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Weight** | 0.6 | How much character identity to preserve (0.1–1.0). Lower = more chibi freedom, higher = more concept fidelity. |
| **End At** | 0.7 | When IP-Adapter stops influencing generation (0.3–1.0). Lower = prompt has more final say on proportions. |

These settings are persisted per-character in the manifest and restored on load.

### Blank Image Detection

Seurat automatically retries generation (up to 3 times with different seeds) when ComfyUI produces blank or black images, which can happen with certain model/prompt combinations.

## Animation Preview

The main pane shows an animation preview when an animation is selected:

- **With generated frames**: Plays back individual frame images directly (no spritesheet needed)
- **With assembled spritesheet**: Shows the full spritesheet with grid overlay and frame highlighting
- Use the **play/pause** button or **spacebar** to control playback

## Workflow

### Concept Pipeline (5-step sequential, in the "Concept Pipeline" panel)

1. **Identity Concept** — describe the character, configure style prompt, generate or upload concept art
2. **Detect Skeleton** — run DWPreprocessor on the concept image to extract the anchor skeleton
3. **Derive View Skeletons** — derive directional pose skeletons (front/back/right/left) from the anchor; click to edit individual keypoints
4. **Generate Directional Concepts** — IP-Adapter + OpenPose generates concept art for each direction using derived skeletons
5. **Generate Chibi** — generate chibi versions from concept art; IP-Adapter preserves character identity

Each step has a status badge (pending/ready/done) and is disabled until its prerequisite is complete.

### Sprite Generation

6. **Derive animation poses** — click "Derive Poses from Anchor" in the Pipeline panel to create character-proportioned skeletons for all animation frames
7. **Generate sprites** — select an animation, run Pass 1 (pose generation) + Pass 2 (chibi styling) on all frames
8. **(Optional) Interpolate** — generate in-between frames for smoother animation (blend or RIFE)
9. **Pixelize** — run Pass 3 on all frames to produce final pixel art
10. **Review frames** — approve, reject, or regenerate individual frames
11. **Assemble atlas** — validate and build the final spritesheet PNG
