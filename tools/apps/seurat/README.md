# Seurat — Sprite Art Pipeline

Seurat is a browser-based tool for generating, reviewing, and assembling pixel-art sprite sheets for the Vulkan game engine. It connects to a local [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) server for AI image generation and the bridge server for asset management.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start ComfyUI (must be running for generation)
cd tools/ComfyUI
./venv/bin/python main.py --listen localhost --port 8188 --force-fp32 --enable-cors-header "*"

# 2. Start the bridge server
cd tools/apps/bridge
pnpm dev

# 3. Start Seurat
cd tools/apps/seurat
pnpm dev
# Open http://localhost:5179
```

## UI Layout

Seurat uses a 3-pane layout:

| Pane | Width | Content |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Tree** (left) | 220px | Character & animation tree explorer |
| **Main** (center) | flex | Content viewer — concept art, animation preview, frame grid |
| **Right** (right) | 300px | Action panels — generation settings, review, atlas assembly |

### Tree Navigation

- Click **Manifest** to view stats and edit raw JSON
- Click a **character** to view/edit concept art and assemble atlas
- Click an **animation** to review frames, generate sprites, and preview playback

## ComfyUI Setup

Seurat requires a running ComfyUI instance with Stable Diffusion 1.5. ComfyUI **must** be started with `--force-fp32 --enable-cors-header "*"`. The `--force-fp32` flag is required on Apple Silicon (MPS) to prevent ControlNet precision issues that cause OpenPose pose guidance to fail. The `--enable-cors-header` flag is needed since Seurat makes cross-origin requests directly from the browser to the ComfyUI API.

### Required Models

Place these in your ComfyUI `models/` directories:

| Type | File | Directory |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Checkpoint** | `v1-5-pruned-emaonly.safetensors` | `models/checkpoints/` |
| **LoRA** | `PixelArtRedmond15V-PixelArt-PIXARFK.safetensors` | `models/loras/` |
| **ControlNet (Tile)** | `control_v11f1e_sd15_tile.pth` | `models/controlnet/` |

- **Checkpoint**: [v1-5-pruned-emaonly](https://huggingface.co/stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5) — base SD 1.5 model
- **LoRA**: [PixelArtRedmond](https://civitai.com/models/120096) — pixel art style LoRA
- **ControlNet**: [control_v11f1e_sd15_tile](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1) — tile model for character consistency

### Optional Models (for IP-Adapter + OpenPose mode)

| Type | File | Directory |
|------|------|-----------|
| **IP-Adapter** | `ip-adapter-plus_sd15.safetensors` | `models/ipadapter/` |
| **CLIP Vision** | `CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K.safetensors` | `models/clip_vision/` |
| **ControlNet (OpenPose)** | `control_v11p_sd15_openpose.pth` | `models/controlnet/` |

- **IP-Adapter**: [ip-adapter-plus_sd15](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter) — character appearance consistency from concept art
- **CLIP Vision**: [CLIP-ViT-H-14](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter) — vision encoder required by IP-Adapter
- **OpenPose ControlNet**: [control_v11p_sd15_openpose](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1) — pose-guided generation

### Optional Custom Nodes

| Node | Purpose | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| [ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus) | IP-Adapter support | `git clone` into `custom_nodes/` |
| [ComfyUI-BRIA_AI-RMBG](https://github.com/ZHO-ZHO-ZHO/ComfyUI-BRIA_AI-RMBG) | Background removal | `git clone` into `custom_nodes/`, download `model.pth` into `RMBG-1.4/` |

### ComfyUI Settings (in Seurat UI)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| URL | `http://127.0.0.1:8188` | ComfyUI server address |
| Steps | 30 | Diffusion sampling steps (IP-Adapter needs 30+ for convergence) |
| CFG | 7 | Classifier-free guidance scale |
| Seed | -1 | Random seed (-1 = random each time) |
| Sampler | `euler` | Sampling algorithm (recommended for Apple Silicon MPS) |
| Denoise | 0.55 | How much to change from the reference image (0 = no change, 1 = full regeneration) |

### LoRA Configuration

Add/remove LoRA models in the **LoRA** section. Each entry has:
- **Name**: filename without `.safetensors` extension
- **Weight**: strength of the LoRA effect (0.0–2.0, default 0.8)

### ControlNet Configuration

ControlNet tiles the concept art horizontally and uses it as conditioning to maintain character consistency across animation frames.

- **Model**: ControlNet model filename (without `.pth`). Clear to disable.
- **Strength**: conditioning strength (0.0–1.5, default 0.70)

### IP-Adapter + OpenPose Configuration

Uses IP-Adapter for character appearance consistency from concept art, combined with OpenPose ControlNet for per-frame pose control. Requires the optional models and `ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus` custom node.

- **IP Weight**: IP-Adapter influence strength (0.1–1.0, default 0.70)
- **Preset**: IP-Adapter model variant (default "PLUS (high strength)")
- **End At**: When IP-Adapter stops influencing generation (0.0–1.0, default 1.0). Lower values give the text prompt more control in later denoising steps.
- **Pose Model**: OpenPose ControlNet model filename (default `control_v11p_sd15_openpose`)
- **Pose Strength**: OpenPose conditioning strength (0.1–1.5, default 0.80)

When enabled, Seurat generates each frame individually with a programmatically rendered OpenPose skeleton matching the expected pose (idle breathing, walk cycle, run cycle) for each direction and frame index. Pose skeletons use a **14-keypoint format** (no mid_hip) where neck connects directly to r_hip and l_hip — this is the format OpenPose ControlNet v1.1 expects.

**IP-Adapter embeds_scaling**: Pass-1 identity nodes use `"V only"` — this provides the best character consistency while letting the text prompt control composition, direction, and pose. Pass-2 chibi nodes use `"K+mean(V) w/ C penalty"` to reduce background leakage during style transfer. The `weight_type` is `"linear"` for all passes.

**Prompt override**: The Pipeline panel includes an editable **Prompt** textarea above Pass 1. When empty, auto-generated per-frame prompts are used. When filled, the custom prompt replaces the auto prompt for all frames, allowing quick iteration on prompt wording.

> **Note on frame prompts**: Frame prompts intentionally exclude the concept's `style_prompt` (e.g. "pen drawing, detailed linework") because IP-Adapter already transfers style from the reference image. Including style terms in the text prompt would double down on a specific style and fight against IP-Adapter. Direction terms (e.g. "facing right, right side profile, looking right") are placed first in the prompt for strongest orientation influence.

### Background Removal

Removes opaque backgrounds from generated sprites (SD 1.5 does not natively support alpha output). Requires the `ComfyUI-BRIA_AI-RMBG` custom node with its `RMBG-1.4/model.pth` weights.

- **Node**: ComfyUI class_type for the RemBG node (default `BRIA_RMBG_Zho`)

Background removal operates at multiple stages:

1. **Reference pre-processing**: When IP-Adapter + RemBG are both enabled, concept art and chibi reference images are run through RemBG *before* being fed to IP-Adapter. The cleaned images are then **composited onto a solid white background** (via `compositeOnWhite()`) to prevent black/transparent regions from muddying the IP-Adapter character identity embedding. Results are cached per-view direction.
2. **Inter-pass cleanup** (two-pass mode): RemBG runs between Pass 1 (concept+pose) and Pass 2 (chibi-fy). The extracted character is composited onto a **solid white background** before VAEEncode — this prevents black/transparent regions from becoming latent noise artifacts in Pass 2.
3. **Final output**: Standard RemBG on the final generated image.

Frame prompts use `plain white background, solid color background` (SD 1.5 handles solid white reliably) and negative prompts include environment-related terms (`detailed background, room, interior, exterior, furniture, floor, wall, ceiling, sky, ground, environment`).

## Generation Modes

Seurat automatically selects the generation mode based on available assets and settings:

| Mode | When | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **txt2img** | No concept art uploaded | Generates from text prompt only |
| **img2img** | Concept art exists, ControlNet model cleared | Uses concept art as starting image |
| **ControlNet + img2img** | Concept art exists + ControlNet model set | Tiles concept art for ControlNet conditioning + img2img |
| **IP-Adapter + OpenPose** | IP-Adapter enabled + concept art exists | Per-frame generation with character consistency + pose control |
| **IP-Adapter (chibi)** | Chibi generation from Concept Art view | txt2img + IP-Adapter for chibi proportions with character identity |

### Generation Scope

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Single** | Generate one frame at a time |
| **Row** | Generate all frames of an animation as one wide image, then auto-slice into individual frames |
| **All** | Generate all pending frames across all animations (row mode per animation) |

Row mode generates a horizontal sprite strip (e.g., 512x128 for 4 frames of 128x128) and slices it into individual frame PNGs. This produces more consistent animations than single-frame generation.

When IP-Adapter + OpenPose is enabled, row mode generates each frame individually (per-frame pose skeletons) rather than as a single strip.

### Chibi Generation (IP-Adapter Only)

Chibi generation uses **txt2img + IP-Adapter** (no ControlNet or img2img). This approach generates chibi versions from scratch using the prompt to control proportions (2-head body ratio, big head, small body), while IP-Adapter preserves the character's identity from the concept art reference image.

This is better than the previous img2img approach, which forced a tradeoff: low denoise preserved the concept but couldn't change body proportions, while high denoise changed proportions but lost character identity.

**IP-Adapter settings** (adjustable in the Chibi UI):

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Weight** | 0.6 | How much character identity to preserve (0.1–1.0). Lower = more chibi freedom, higher = more concept fidelity. |
| **End At** | 0.7 | When IP-Adapter stops influencing generation (0.3–1.0). Lower = prompt has more final say on proportions. |

These settings are persisted per-character in the manifest and restored on load.

### Blank Image Detection

Seurat automatically retries generation (up to 3 times with different seeds) when ComfyUI produces blank or black images, which can happen with certain model/prompt combinations.

## Animation Preview

The main pane shows an animation preview when an animation is selected:

- **With generated frames**: Plays back individual frame images directly (no spritesheet needed)
- **With assembled spritesheet**: Shows the full spritesheet with grid overlay and frame highlighting
- Use the **play/pause** button or **spacebar** to control playback

## Workflow

1. **Create a character** via the tree's "+ New Character" button
2. **Set up concept art** — describe the character, configure style prompt, generate or upload concept art (per-direction: front, back, right, left)
3. **Generate chibi** — generate chibi versions from concept art using IP-Adapter for character identity; adjust IP-Adapter weight/end_at for the balance between chibi proportions and concept fidelity
4. **Generate sprites** — select an animation, configure ComfyUI settings, generate frames
5. **Review frames** — approve, reject, or regenerate individual frames
6. **Assemble atlas** — validate and build the final spritesheet PNG
