# ComfyUI Asset Generation Research Report

## Overview

Research into using ComfyUI with Stable Diffusion 1.5 on Apple Silicon (MPS) for generating medieval RPG pixel art assets: 24 tileset tiles and 288 character sprite frames (6 characters x 3 states x 4 directions x 4 frames).

## Environment

- **ComfyUI**: v0.16.1
- **Model**: `v1-5-pruned-emaonly.safetensors` (SD 1.5)
- **LoRA**: `PixelArtRedmond15V-PixelArt-PIXARFK.safetensors` (trigger: `Pixel Art, PIXARFK`)
- **Device**: Apple Silicon MPS (16GB unified RAM)
- **Client**: `@vulkan-game/ai-providers` ComfyUIClient (TypeScript, via Node.js)

## Key Findings

### 1. Black Image Problem on MPS

The most significant issue encountered was **black (empty) 512x512 PNG outputs** (~2KB). This affected 30-60% of generations depending on configuration.

**Root Cause**: MPS fp16 precision instability in the VAE decoder and diffusion model. Certain seed values cause numerical underflow/overflow that produces all-black latent outputs.

**Mitigations tested**:

| Flag | Effect | Quality Impact |
|------|--------|---------------|
| `--fp32-vae` | Reduces black rate to ~30-40% | No quality loss, slight speed decrease |
| `--cpu-vae` | Same as fp32-vae (~30-40% black) | No quality loss |
| `--force-fp32` | Reduces black rate to ~20% | **Degrades quality significantly** — model produces blurry/abstract outputs |
| LoRA loaded | Reduces black rate independently | LoRA presence changes latent space, avoiding some degenerate regions |

**Best solution**: `--fp32-vae` + LoRA + retry with different seeds (prime offset `seed + 7919 * attempt`). With 10 retries, success rate reaches ~99%.

### 2. LoRA Weight Impact

| Weight | Pixel Art Consistency | Color Accuracy | Degenerate Rate |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0.65 | Low — often non-pixel-art | Better natural colors | Low noise |
| 0.75 | Medium | Good balance | Medium |
| 0.85 | High — strong pixel art style | Sometimes garish (magenta/neon) | Higher noise |

**Recommendation**: Weight 0.85 for strongest pixel art style. Accept occasional color issues as trade-off for consistent style.

### 3. Sampler Comparison

| Sampler | Quality | Consistency | Speed |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------|
| `euler` | Best overall | Good with LoRA | Fast |
| `euler_ancestral` | Poor — abstract blobs | Very inconsistent | Fast |
| `dpmpp_2m` | OK — scene-style | Mixed | Medium |
| `dpmpp_sde` | Poor — noisy | Very inconsistent | Slow |

**Recommendation**: `euler` sampler only. Other samplers produced significantly worse results on MPS.

### 4. Tile vs Character Quality

**Character sprites**: Consistently good quality. SD 1.5 understands "character sprite, front view, full body" well. The LoRA enhances the pixel art style effectively.

**Tiles**: Very inconsistent. SD 1.5 struggles with "top-down RPG tile" — it tends to generate:
- Full scene views instead of isolated tiles
- Wrong perspective (side view landscapes)
- Abstract patterns or noise
- Unrelated imagery

**Recommendation**: Character sprites are production-viable with curation. Tiles need manual review and may require re-generation or hand-editing.

### 5. MPS Numerical Instability Across Restarts

The same seed + prompt + settings can produce **different outputs** after restarting ComfyUI. This is due to MPS non-deterministic behavior. Results that looked excellent in one session may be garbage in the next.

**Implication**: Cannot rely on "known good seeds" across sessions. Always use retry logic.

## Final Generation Run

## AnimateDiff Integration

### Overview

AnimateDiff generates multi-frame animations from a reference image and a text prompt. It works by injecting temporal motion modules into Stable Diffusion, producing coherent frame sequences rather than individual images.

### Installed Components

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved** | `tools/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved/` | Motion module loader, evolved sampling, context options |
| **ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite** | `tools/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite/` | Frame-to-video combiner (GIF/WebP/MP4 output) |
| **mm_sd_v15_v2.ckpt** | `tools/ComfyUI/models/animatediff_models/` | Motion model for SD 1.5 (~1.7GB) |

VHS Python dependencies (`opencv-python`, `imageio-ffmpeg`) are installed in the ComfyUI venv.

### Workflow Architecture

The AnimateDiff workflow (`buildAnimateDiffWorkflow` in `comfyui.ts`) chains:

```
CheckpointLoaderSimple ──→ ADE_UseEvolvedSampling ──→ KSampler ──→ VAEDecode ──→ VHS_VideoCombine
                               ↑           ↑                                        ↓
ADE_LoadAnimateDiffModel       │           │                                   (GIF/WebP)
  → ADE_ApplyAnimateDiffModelSimple        │
      (M_MODELS) ──────────────┘           │
                                           │
ADE_StandardUniformContextOptions          │
  (CONTEXT_OPTIONS) ───────────────────────┘
                                           │
ADE_EmptyLatentImageLarge (batch) ─────────┘
                                           │
CLIPTextEncode (positive/negative) ────────┘
```

Key node connections:
- `ADE_ApplyAnimateDiffModelSimple` takes only the motion model, outputs `M_MODELS`
- `ADE_UseEvolvedSampling` takes `MODEL` (from checkpoint) + `m_models` (optional, from AnimateDiff) + `context_options`
- `ADE_EmptyLatentImageLarge` generates a batch of latents (one per frame)
- `VHS_VideoCombine` combines decoded frames into a looping animation
- Individual frames are also saved via `SaveImage`

### API Usage

```typescript
import { ComfyUIClient } from "@vulkan-game-tools/ai-providers";

const client = new ComfyUIClient("http://localhost:8188", 1000, 300_000);

const animation = await client.generateAnimateDiff(
  "pixel art character walking animation, side view, game sprite",
  referenceImageBytes,  // Uint8Array of PNG
  {
    motionModel: "mm_sd_v15_v2.ckpt",  // default
    frameCount: 8,       // number of animation frames (default 16)
    frameRate: 8,        // output GIF/WebP frame rate (default 8)
    steps: 20,           // diffusion steps (default 20)
    width: 512,          // generation resolution
    height: 512,
    denoise: 0.6,        // 0.0 = no change, 1.0 = full regen (default 0.6)
    cfgScale: 7,         // classifier-free guidance (default 7)
    samplerName: "euler", // recommended for MPS
    outputFormat: "image/gif",  // or "image/webp" (default)
    loopCount: 0,        // 0 = infinite loop
  }
);

// With automatic retry on blank images:
const result = await client.generateAnimateDiffWithRetry(
  prompt, referenceImage, opts, 3  // maxRetries
);

// List available motion models:
const models = await client.listMotionModels();
```

### MPS / Apple Silicon Notes

- **`--force-fp32` is required** for AnimateDiff on MPS. Unlike single-image generation where `--cpu-vae` suffices, AnimateDiff produces all-black frames without full fp32 precision.
- **`--cpu-vae` alone is NOT enough** — the motion module's temporal attention layers also need fp32.
- Expect higher memory usage and slower generation (~2-4min for 8 frames at 512x512, 15 steps).
- Later frames in longer sequences (16+) may show quality degradation/noise. For sprite animations, 4-8 frames is the sweet spot.

### Recommended Launch Command

```bash
cd tools/ComfyUI
./venv/bin/python main.py --listen --enable-cors-header '*' --force-fp32
```

### Quality Tips

- Use **8 frames** for walk/run cycles (matches the game's 4-frame animation structure with interpolation)
- Pair with **PixelArtRedmond15V LoRA** (weight 0.85) for consistent pixel art style
- Keep **denoise at 0.5-0.7** for motion that preserves the reference character's appearance
- Use `euler` sampler — other samplers produce worse results on MPS
- For production sprite sheets, generate frames individually via the existing IP-Adapter+OpenPose pipeline for more control; use AnimateDiff for motion reference/prototyping

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Use SDXL or a dedicated pixel art model** for better tile generation. SD 1.5 lacks understanding of top-down game tiles.

2. **Add a pixel art LoRA trained on RPG tilesets** (e.g., PixelArtRedmond trained on top-down maps) for tile-specific generation.

3. **Post-processing pipeline**: Downscale 512x512 to 16x16 or 32x32 with nearest-neighbor sampling for actual game integration (the Pixel Painter's `downscaleToPixelData()` function does this).

4. **Manual curation pass**: Not all non-black images are usable. Estimate ~70% of character sprites and ~40% of tiles are good quality. A human review step is essential.

5. **Consider img2img**: Start from a rough pixel art sketch and use SD to refine it. This gives much more control over composition and perspective.

6. **GPU recommendation**: For production use, an NVIDIA GPU avoids all MPS precision issues. The black image problem is entirely an Apple Silicon limitation.

## Script Location

The generation script is at: `/tmp/generate_medieval_rpg_final.mjs`

Key features:
- Skip logic for already-generated files (`existsSync` + size check)
- Retry with prime seed offsets for black image recovery
- LoRA integration via ComfyUIClient `loras` parameter
- Sequential generation (ComfyUI queues don't handle parallel well on MPS)
